			What is Taoism?
		</h1>
		<p>
			To many people, a confusing aspect of Taoism is its very definition. Many religions will happily teach philosophy and dogma which in reflection defines a person. Taoism flips this around. It starts by teaching a truth; “The Tao” is indefinable. It then follows up by teaching that each person can discover the Tao on their terms. A teaching like this can be very hard to grasp when most people desire very concrete definitions in their own life.

			A simple way to start learning the definition of Taoism is to start within yourself. Here are three easy starting steps to learning Taoism:
			<ol style="width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
				<li>Don’t concentrate on the meaning of Tao (this will come later naturally)</li>
				<li>Understand what Taoism is. Taoism is more than just a “philosophy” or a “religion”. Taoism should be understood as being: A system of belief, attitudes, and practices set towards the service and living to a person’s nature.</li>
				<li>The path of understanding Taoism is simply accepting oneself. Live life and discover who you are. Your nature is ever changing and is always the same. Don’t try to resolve the various contradictions in life, instead learn acceptance of your nature.</li>
			</ol>
