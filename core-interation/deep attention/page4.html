				<li>If you need a guide to Taoism, then first start with these three books:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://personaltao.com/recommended-books/tao-te-ching-2/">Tao Te Ching</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://personaltao.com/recommended-books/chuang-tzu/">Chuang Tzu</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://personaltao.com/gallery/taoist-book/">A Personal Tao</a></li>
					</ul>
					I recommend starting with A Personal Tao, as it’s specifically written with a modern perspective to help people discover their nature. Due to the nature of Taoist writings, you can easily read all three at the same time and intermix the ideas.
				</li>
				<li>If you desire a person as a guide, you can find a Taoist temple, Zen Dojo or local sage to chat with occasionally. Taoism’s deepest truths must come from the inside, but at times it’s helpful to get an outside perspective to see your nature. If you are in the Oakland area of California, I highly recommend The Taoist Center. Dr. Alex Feng is an incredibly open and sincere Taoist Master. I also offer personal Taoist Retreats and <a href="https://personaltao.com/services/school/">Taoism Classes</a>.</li>
				<li>If you cannot find a local resource, then start keeping a journal and over time review it. A journal becomes a nice mirror to reflect upon our nature as we move through life.
</li>
